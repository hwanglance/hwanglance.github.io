# DISCLAIMER
This is an essay to be written for a software engineering course.  The essay topic is supposed to be about anything UI framework-related, although our course specifically uses Semantic UI as our UI framework and as of writing this essay I am actually not even complete with the basic learning material for Semantic UI which consists of specific portions of this course on Pluralsight.  Hence, I probably don't want to be spending too much time writing this essay, so I can catch up with the basic material.  That being said, I'll try to write what I can for now and perhaps in the future I might rewrite this essay, or take it down, which would be unfortunate if you happen to find this essay somehow helpful to you.

## What is Semantic UI (for the college software engineering student)?
Semantic UI seems to be so complicated and intricate that I cannot describe all of it in a brief essay like this, but from what I know about it, it seems like something you use in HTML and CSS to gain access to classes that are specified with very natural-sounding language (compared to regular HTML and CSS code, don't expect to type directly into your coding environment as if you're telling a human being how you want your webpage to look like).  There are many classes that come with Semantic UI and some things that set Semantic UI classes apart from raw HTML and CSS classes is that these classes are like building blocks for creating modern-looking webpages but while minimizing the need for specifying numerical 'pixel minutia' typically found in raw HTML and CSS.  Creating modern-looking webpages using raw HTML and CSS sounds like a nightmare while on the other hand, making modern-looking webpages using Semantic UI seems at least doable.
